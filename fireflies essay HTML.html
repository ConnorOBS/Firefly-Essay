            Introduction: Distribution, Taxonomy, and Flashing Behavior. 
        </h2>
        <p> There are more than 2,000 identified species of firefly, 110 genera worldwide, found everywhere except Antarctica.
            Around 125 species are found in North America
            <cite>(ISU, 2018)(Rogers, 2007)(Myers et. al, 2018)</cite>.
            More species are found in humid areas of the world, expecially closer to the equator in Africa, Asia, Central and South America
            <cite>(Faust, 2017)(Lewis, 2016)</cite>.
            Many well-known flashing species live in the eastern continental US and Canada, but some dry adapted, non-flashing species exist in places like Colorado.
            While this essay will not focus on the non-flashing, local Colorado species, an acknowledgment of their existence is important for a complete natural history. 
            </p>
        <p>
            The Lampyridae family came under greater study in the 1800's, when many common genus like
             <i>Photinus</i><cite>(Laporte 1833)</cite>, <i>Ellychnia</i><cite>(Blanchard 1845)</cite>, and <i>Photuris</i><cite>(LeConte 1852)</cite> were first named.
             The genera have been revised by a small group of people since the 1950's, including Frank A. McDermott. The classification of species has taken longer to be improved,
             but overall interest in fireflies has increased since the turn of the 21st century, partly due to concern over light pollution and habitat destruction <cite>(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most cultures have some reference or word describing members of the Lampyridae family. In the romance and germanic languages the words all reference ember, spark, flame, flashing, or lantern. 
            In english the terms firefly, lightening bug, and glow worm are used loosely to refer to any glowing insect. 
            Many types of insects have <dfn>bioluminescence</dfn>, the production and emission of light by living organisms, including: beetles, flies, true bugs, and termites.
            Most glowing beetles belong to either the Lampyridae or Elateridae family<cite>(ISU, 2018)(Rogers, 2007)(McDermott, 1911)</cite>.
            Glow worms would be a more inclusive common name for Lampyridae than firefly, as all Lampyridae larvae glow,
            yet this name is also ambiguous since other invertebrate larvae also glow <cite>(Lewis, 2016)</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bioluminescence is used to attract and communicate with potential mates in adult fireflies<cite>(Rogers, 2007)(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>. The showy flashes are performed primarily by the males,
            with a pale, less noticeable flash response from receptive females. Flashes can also be used to communicate danger, rejection, or competition between males. 
            <q>Each species of firefly has a signature male falsh apttern that his own female can recognize</q><cite>(Faust, 2017)</cite>,
            so flashes are a primary diagnostic feature for identifying different species.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flashing behavior can last anywhere from twenty mintues to all night, depending on the species. Males tend to flash longer and more competitvely halfway through their short mating season. 
            The habitat, time of year, time of evening, distance off the ground and flight pattern can all be specific to a firefly species. The major flashing genera found in North America are genus 
            <i>Photuris</i>, <i>Photinus</i>, and <i> Pyractomena</i>. 
            Glowing genera like <i>Phausis</i> and dark or non-bioluminescent genera <i>Pyropyga</i>, <i>Lucidota</i>, and <i>Ellychnia</i> are also common across North America 
            <cite>(Faust, 2017)(Lewis, 2016)(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>.

            General Beetle Anatomy
        </h2>
        <p>
            The wondrous fireflies are in fact <dfn>beetles</dfn> in the Lampyridae family, of the insect order Coleoptera, Greek for <em>sheath-wings</em><cite>(Imes, 1996)</cite>.
            This refers to the hardened forewings called <dfn>elytra</dfn>, which act as sheilds for the delicate, membranous hind wings used in flight. When folded, the elytra meet in a straight line down
            the middle of the dorsal side of the body. 
            Lampyridae beetles have soft elytra, don't fly long distance, and are generally slow enough to be caught by children on a warm summer night <cite>(McDermott, 1910)</cite>.
            All beetles have chewing mouthparts with mandibles adapted to herbivory, scavenging, or predation. 
            They also have antennae between two prominent compound eyes<cite>(Pechenik, 2015)(insectID.org, 2018)</cite>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Bioluminescent Communication">
                Bioluminescent Communication
        </h2>
        <p>
            The pattern of bioluminescence varies: some have simple to complicated flash patterns, some glow or flicker, and some have no light organs at all<cite>(Rogers, 2007)</cite>.
            Every summer in the United States thousands of people rush up the Smoky Mountains of Elkmont Tennessee to view <em>The Light Show</em>,
             the synchronous, flash-train mating behavior of <i>Photinus carolinus</i> fireflies. Thousands of male <i>P. carolinus</i> will continue
              a pattern of <q>six quick flashes followed by six seconds of darkness</q> for about two hours every year in June<cite>(Lewis, 2016)</cite>. 
              This synchronous behavior is not well understood, but it does occur in dense populations. Large populations are usually found in humid, densely forested areas that are very dark and undisturbed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Light intensity and flash frequency are controlled by the firefly nervous system<cite>(insectID.org, 2018)</cite>. Firefly species can produce different wavelengths of light,
            ranging from 520-600 nanometers or blue/green to yellow/orange colors<cite>(Faust, 2017)(McDermott, 1910)</cite>.
            This variability might correspond to the time of night each species mates, color and light intensity can be dramatically different throughout the night,
             meaning fireflies are adapted to specific time and light periods. Communication with light between males and females is a common behavior, however there are deviations in how each species uses it. 
            Some firefly species have flightless females that communicate by glowing, while the males have no light organs, like the common European firefly <i>Lampyris noctiluca</i>. 
            These flightless, glowing females can appear more larvae like as adults, leading to the common name glow worm instead of firefly<cite>(Faust, 2017)(Lewis, 2016)(McDermott, 1910)</cite>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Briefly mentioned during the introduction, some genera and species of adult Lampyridae lack bioluminescence, like the diurnal <i>Ellychnia</i> genus found in western North America.
            Molecular data shows adult fireflies have lost and gained light organs multiple times over the evolution of family Lampyridae. Over a dozen species exist across the western slopes of the
            Rocky Mountains. This genus also includes the <q>Winter Firefly</q> species <i>E. corrusaca</i> that live on branches of trees over the winter, found all the way into boreal zones of Canada
            <cite>(Lewis, 2016)(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The soldier beetles (Cantharidae), click beetles (Elateridae), and net-winged beetles (Lycidae) can all look and act very similar to true fireflies<cite>(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>.
            The <dfn>pronotum</dfn> shield covering the head is unique to the Lampyridae adults, an immediate difference from other beetle families. The fact that some beetle families glow is a result of convergent
            evolution, not a measure of relatedness. Organisms from fungus to dinoflagellates to cockroaches have all separately produced lineages with bioluminescence
             because it turned out to be a useful evolutionary adaptation <cite>(Loncraine, Filatsch, Dohrn, 2016)(Pechenik, 2015)(Imes, 1996)</cite>. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="Lampyridae Anatomy, Morphology, and Identification">
            Lampyridae Anatomy, Morphology, and Identification
        </h2>
        <p>
            There is considerable variation in the morphology between genus and species, even between males and females of the same species. However there are two basic characteristics all members
            of Lampyridae share: extended adult pronotums cover the head segment and larvae or pupae bioluminescence <cite>(Faust, 2017)(Rogers, 2007)</cite>. The thorax body segment is divided into three 
            distinct sub-segments: prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax. The pronotum, on the ventral side of the prothorax, is usually prominent, while the meso and meta thorax segments and most of the abdomen
            are hidden under the soft elytra. The most reliable identification feature has been small differencs of the male genitalia, requiring a dissecting scope. Sometimes identification is dependent on 
            both male and female genitalia, like in the genera <i>Photinus</i>.
             Modern methods incorporate other more visible features for taxonomic keys, in addition to male genitalia<cite>(Imes, 1996)(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last few segments of a male abdomen is modified into a <q>fleur de lis</q> shape, which holds a retractable penis called an aedeagus.
            The females have an ovipositor, which helps them deposit fertilized eggs<cite>(Faust, 2017)</cite>. Terrestrial arthropods developed internal fertilization, where the male presents a package of 
            sperm and other nutrients called a spermatophore to the females. In fireflies the spermatophore also contains lucibufagins, a group of bitter defensive chemicals. The female stores the sperm
            in a specialized compartment called a spermatheca for later use<cite>(Pechenik, 2015)(Lewis, 2016)(KQED, PBS, 2018)</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The specimens pictured to the left were taken from my family's garden in Iowa, probably genus <i>Photinus</i>. Genus <i>Photinus</i>, which includes the common eastern firefly species <i>P. pyralis</i>,
            are found in woodland and riparian habitats throughout the temperate to tropical zones of North and South America. <i>Pyralis</i> is latin for <q>born of fire</q>, <i>P. pyralis</i> was named by
            Linnaeus in 1767<cite>(ISU, 2018)</cite>. They are small to large nocturnal flyers with yellow colored flashes. <i>P. pyralis</i> has a distinctive <q>J</q> or hooked light flash, giving it the 
            common name <q>Big Dipper</q><cite>(insectID.org, 2018)(KQED, PBS, 2018)</cite>. Some female wings are smaller and reduced, so the males are often the ones seen flying. <i>Photinus</i> size is 
            between 4-19mm with pale bordered elytra. The head sheild has a <q>dark bar or spot in the center with bright red-orange spots on each side</q><cite>(Faust, 2017)</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p> The ubiquitous bioluminescence associated with fireflies is produced in a specialized light organ near the end of the abdomen<cite>(Rogers, 2007)</cite>. The number of lantern segments is a 
            diagnostic characteristic for distinquishing the males from females. 
            The <i>Photinus</i> males have <q>two full segments modified into light organs, whereas the females have only one</q><cite>(Weissmann, 2018)</cite>. Males of many firefly genus, including <i>Photinus</i>,
            also have four large pores on their two lantern segments called stigmatiform pores<cite>(Faust, 2017)</cite>. Insects technically have eleven abdominal segments, but many of the derived descendents have lost or fused segments during their evolutionary history. In the case of Lampyridae beetles, 
            external morphology shows between eight and nine segments<cite>(Weissmann, 2018)(Pechenik, 2015)</cite>. This can be hard to identify, since the last segments are smaller and modified for genitalia. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Firefly light organs are very sensitive to any stiumuli, such as squeezing, certain chemicals, or simply switching on a porch light. The organ can continue to be stimualted when separated from 
            the body, much like a chicken with its head cut off can still run around. Documented experiments going back to the early 1800's found dried light organs can produce light if moistened and aerated. 
            Even when powdered and stored for a period of time, light could be produced with some help from chemical reagents<cite>(McDermott, 1910)</cite>.  
        </p>

        <h2 id="Lampyridae Lifecycle">
            Lampyridae Lifecycle
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Lampyridae family of beetles are holometabolous, meaning they go through complete metamorphosis: egg, larvae, pupae, and imago. The average firefly lives about two years to complete its life cycle,
            the majority spent as a larvae, while the iconic adult or imago stage is only a few weeks long<cite>(ISU, 2018)(Rogers, 2007)(Imes, 1996)(Pechenik, 2015)</cite>. 
            The eggs take one to three weeks to hatch larvae, the main stage of development in a firefly's life. The larval stage can last one to two years,
             most of its time spent eating and growing in terrestrial to aquatic environments.Larvae are predatory scavengers, eating many kinds of soft-bodied invertebrates, such as: worms, molluscs and other insects.
             The chewing mandibulate mouthparts contain hollow teeth that inject venom into its prey, paralzying and essentially melting the organism from the inside out. As the larvae grow, they must moult and shed
             their old exoskeletons. A firefly larva will go through four to seven moults before reaching the pupae stage. The time between each moult is called an <q>instar</q><cite>(Faust,2017)(Lewis, 2016)</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The pupal stage is more immobile, this is when the firelfy larvae body goes through huge morphologic reorganization in to thte eventual imago or adult body form.
            Most eggs, larvae, and pupae will live deep in the soil, bark, and logs during colder winter months, emerging in the spring and summer as adults. An exception to this are the <i>Ellychnia corrusca</i>
            species, the adult stage will emerge and lie dormant on exposed trees during winter months in a kind of stasis until spring<cite>(Faust, 2017)(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>. 
            Adults generally put all their energy into mating, so while adults still possess mouthparts, they are seldom used in comparison to larval stages of consumption<cite>(insectID.org, 2018)(Rogers, 2007)</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Adults have defensive cardiac glycosides, which they can acquire from eating milkweed nectar<cite>(Lewis, 2016)</cite>. The females of the <i>P. vericolor</i> species can't produce lucibufagins,
             so they consume the males of another species, <i>P. pyralis</i>. They trick males to get closer by emitting the same response flash pattern of a female species, then attack at close range.
            The male is, however, not defenseless against the larger female predator.<i>P. pyralis</i> males can secrete a sticky white goo to gum up the jaws of the attacker, allowing him to escape<cite>(KQED, PBS, 2018)</cite>. 
           Femme fatales are always fun to find in nature, a reminder that sexual dimorphism can tip size and dominance in either gender's favor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Brunei Tribe in Borneo are known to eat fireflies like the <i>Photuris</i> femme fatales, but for different reasons: <q>to bring mental sharpness</q><cite>(Faust, 2017)</cite>. 
            The <q>mental sharpness</q> comes from cardiac glycosides, lucibufagins specifically, part of a cocktail of defensive chemicals in fireflies<cite>(ISU, 2018)(Rogers, 2007)</cite>. 
            Turns out the cardiac glycosides in fireflies are extremely similar to the digitalis found in the foxglove plant. These drugs are used to treat congestive heart failure, but they 
            are still basically a steroidal stimulant, so the Brunei certainly were feeling something. Consuming too many fireflies can kill a human, as any high dose of a chemical can turn deadly.  
        </p>
        <h2 id="Chemistry of Bioluminescence">
            Chemistry of Bioluminescence
        </h2>
        <p>
            Regardless of Western or Eastern culture, the fireflies are a shared cultural symbol of magic, death, stars, and the shortness of life itself. 
            They can be cursed or blessed omens depending on the place, but generally are not considered pests.
            Because of the partial disturbed, dark habitat a graveyard offers, fireflies do tend to haunt local cemeteries. 
            This has led to lore associating firefly glow with the souls of the dead in many cultures<cite>(Faust, 2017)</cite>. 
            Firefly bioluminescence has capture the attention of 20th and 21st century scientists as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientists in the early 1900's made some astute specualtions on the chemistry and biology of firefly luminescence. Raphael Dubois coined the terms <em>luciferase</em> and <em>luciferin</em>,
            though the exact chemical compound was still unknown.
            They did know the production of light involved oxidation and moisture. The tracheol network within the light organ lended to thsi new hypothesis<cite>(McDermott, 1910)</cite>.
            The enzyme is accurately named afte the latin term lucifer, meaning <q>lightbringer or morning star</q>.
            When in the presence of magnesium ions, the energy molecule <abbr title="Adenosine Triphosphate">ATP</abbr>, and oxygen, fireflies can produce light.
            The firefly nervous system controls the intensity and on/off switch for bioluminescence. 
            The chemicals nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide also seem to play a role in regualting the on/off switch<cite>(Faust, 2017)(Lewis, 2016)</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            All fireflies possess the luciferase gene and can produce an efficient <q>cold light</q> at some point in their development. 
            Equally or more efficient than an LED bulb, the light produced by this biochemical reaction has 90% energy efficiency. 
            This means only 10% of the light energy produced is lost as heat, in contrast incandescent bulbs lose 90% of their energy to heat<cite>(McDermott, 1910)(Branchini, 2015)(Faust, 2017)</cite>. 
            The practical applications of firefly bioluminescence have been tinkered with for generations.
            For example, during the industrial revolution of the 1900's the diea that <q>living lamps</q> could be useful for coal mining, with no risk of explosion, since very little heat is produced<cite>(McDermott, 1911)</cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D</abbr> Bruce Branchini of Connecticut College and others from Yale University published an article in 2015 with new insights for the chemistry of firefly bioluminescence.
            Turns out, the oxygen used in the chemical process involving luciferin and luciferase  utilizes superoxide ions. This is a special type of molecular oxygen that carries an extra electron, making it
            an extremely reactive chemical. Superoxide is dangerous to many animals, causing cell damage and inflammation. 
            Most biological systems use antioxidants to combat destructiove chemicals, while fireflies utilize them in reactions with luciferase.
            The reactions happen very quickly, in a contained environment within the firefly light organ, so cell damage and inflammation is minimal to nonexistent.
            Uses as a brighter <q>marker molecule</q> are limitless in biomedical research, everything from cancer to bacteria tagging. 
            In 1910, more than 700 references on the <q>the emission of light by organized bodies</q> existed in the western world, famous figures from Aristotle to Pasteur have contributed to the subject. 
            Scientists were aware of luminescence in bacteria, mold, fungi, marigolds, dinoflagellates, ctenophores, and bivalves. 
            Branchini and other collaborators are next looking into the chemistry of bioluminescence in worms and plankton(Branchini, 2015)(McDermott, 1911).

            Conclusion: Threats and Conservation
        </h2>
        <p>
            While no formal journal article of declining firefly populations has been published, there is a lot of sentiment from enthusiasts and field researchers that there are notable changes happening.
            An effort to document firefly populations around the United States was started by the Boston Museum of Natural History in 2008 as a citizen scientist project. 
            The <q>Firefly Watch</q> project will be continued through the Massachusetts Audobon Society and nearby Tufts University starting in the spring of 2018<cite>(Mass Audobon, 2018)</cite>. 
            All of the observations reported from 2008 through 2016 are available to download on their website. 
            Most studies have been done on adult fireflies in moist habitats, so identification of larvae is largely unexplored academic territory<cite>(Luk, Marshall, Branham, 2011)</cite>. 
            While this project is only focused on bioluminescent adults, it is a major step in understanding how firefly populations are changing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the lifecycle of the firefly takes place in the ground, water, and air, they serve as good <q>indicator species</q> to the state of the surrounding environment. 
            Possible factors affecting firefly populations include: artificial light pollution, habitat destruction for housing development, and overuse of agricultural or ornamental lawn pesticides<cite>(Faust, 2017)</cite>. 
            The flightless females and larval habitats are often overlooked because of the ubiquitous flying males. 
            The distruption of developmental stages can have far greater consequences on the stability of populations than focus on the adults alone.
            Everyone can take measures to create better habitats for fireflies by reducing the amount of light spillage from homes at night and leaving sections of their property unmanicured. 
            Even though fireflies are not on the endangered species list, they can benefit from human stewardship. 
            The firefly is a charismatic organism, a source of cultural and scientific inspiration, and an important reminder to turn off the lights.
