# Firefly-Essay
As my first html project, I'm revising an essay I wrote in 2018 for an Invertebrate Zoology course. It is a short natural history of fireflies. I will use this essay
to practice the structural and semantic foundations of html code. For example the bibliography will be an example of lists and link tags. I will endevour to
make the body of the paper accessable and friendly to screen reader apps.
